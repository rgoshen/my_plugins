# CLAUDE.md — my_plugins Marketplace

This repo is a personal Claude Code plugin marketplace. It contains a `marketplace.json` registry and one or more plugins under `plugins/`. All engineering rules from the global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` apply; this file adds project-specific conventions on top.

> **Plugin grouping:** plugins normally live at `plugins/<plugin-name>/`, but may be nested under an optional grouping folder for a plugin *family* — e.g. `plugins/swe/devops-engineer/`. The marketplace `source` points to the actual plugin directory at any depth, and `release.yml` detects plugins by the location of their `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`.

## Plugin Conventions

### Agents are entry points; skills are workflows

The correct component model is:

```
User → Command (/plugin:skill-name) → Agent (persona) → Skill (workflow)
```

- **Agent** — defines WHO: the persona, tools, model, memory, and which skills it carries via `skills:` frontmatter
- **Skill** — defines WHAT: the session workflow and instructions Claude follows; must be self-contained
- **Command** — a thin `.md` in `commands/` that invokes the agent; the user-facing slash command entry point

**Skills must never read agent files by path.** When a user installs a plugin, all files are copied to a cache directory (`~/.claude/plugins/cache/`). Paths like `~/.claude/agents/` will not exist. More importantly, if the agent invoked the skill, the persona is *already active* — the skill reading the agent file would be a redundant circular reference.

**Wrong** (broken path + circular):
```markdown
Read `~/.claude/agents/arch-tutor.md` and adopt that persona.
```

**Right** (skill is pure workflow; persona comes from the agent that invoked it):
```markdown
## Step 1: Resume or kickoff?
...
```

### Agent vs. skill-only — and the command/skill name trap

- Use an **agent** when the work is autonomous and Claude should *delegate* to it (e.g. `devops-engineer`, `ai-engineer`). A subagent runs its task and returns a summary.
- Use a **skill-only** design for **interactive, user-initiated** workflows (e.g. the cs-tutor teach skills). A plugin slash command runs the skill **inline in the main thread**, which is what preserves the back-and-forth; it cannot launch an interactive persona agent. The skill must be self-contained and load any shared skills it needs at startup via the Skill tool.
- **Never give a command and a skill the same name.** They share the `/plugin:name` shortcut and the skill wins — the command is silently shadowed. (Source: code.claude.com/docs/en/skills.)

### Never hardcode `~/.claude/` paths in hooks or MCP configs either
Use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` for paths within the plugin in hook commands and MCP server configs.

### `marketplace.json` rules
- `name` must be kebab-case, no spaces, no uppercase (e.g., `my-plugins`)
- Each plugin entry requires `name` and `source` at minimum
- Do not set `version` in both `plugin.json` and `marketplace.json` — `plugin.json` wins silently and will mask marketplace versions
- Omitting `version` is valid and recommended for active development; Claude Code uses the git commit SHA

### `plugin.json` rules
- Required fields: `name`, `description`, `version`
- Optional but encouraged: `author`, `repository`, `license`, `keywords`
- The `$schema` field is accepted and ignored at runtime — keep it for editor autocomplete

### Skill `SKILL.md` frontmatter required fields
- `name` — kebab-case identifier
- `description` — one line, used for auto-invocation matching

## Validation

Always validate before committing:

```bash
claude plugin validate .
```

Or from inside Claude Code:

```
/plugin validate .
```

Common validation warnings to fix before PR:
- `No marketplace description provided` — add top-level `description` to `marketplace.json`
- `Plugin name is not kebab-case` — rename to lowercase-with-hyphens

---

## Adding a New Plugin

1. Create `plugins/<plugin-name>/` with the structure above
2. Add `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` with required fields
3. Add at least one skill, agent, or command
4. Add `README.md` to the plugin directory
5. Register the plugin in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`
6. Run `claude plugin validate .` and fix all errors
7. Open a PR on a `feature/<plugin-name>` branch

---

## GitHub Actions

CI runs `claude plugin validate .` on every PR. PRs with validation errors will not be merged.

## Installing This Marketplace Locally
